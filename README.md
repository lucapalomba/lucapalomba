## Description

Welcome to my personal portfolio, a website built while testing support for different AI models hosted locally by Ollama! This site showcases my skills and expertise in web development and engineering management. Feel free to explore the various sections.

## Actual Local Development Environment

For this project, I am using Continue.dev locally on my machine. The environment includes:

- **Machine Specification**: CPU i7-7700, RAM 16GB, OS Windows, GPU Nvidia 3060 12GB
- **VS Code**: Integrated development environment with QwenCode2.5-coder:7b for enhanced coding capabilities, used with the Agent Support of Continue.dev
- **Ollama Models**: QwenCode2.5-coder:7b for local AI-assisted development

## Online AI Assistant

In addition to local models, I'm using multiple online AI assistants for this project:

### Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic)

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** is part of the Claude 4 model family and provides:

- Advanced code review and refactoring suggestions
- English grammar and professional tone improvements
- Git commit message generation following conventional commit standards
- Documentation writing and technical content refinement

### Gemini with Antigravity (Google)

**Gemini with Antigravity** is Google's advanced AI coding assistant that offers:

- Agentic workflow with autonomous task planning and execution
- Multi-step code refactoring and implementation
- Intelligent codebase understanding and navigation
- Automated testing and verification
- Real-time browser automation for UI development and testing

Both assistants work together to maintain code quality, ensure professional presentation, and accelerate development across all project materials.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Styling with keyframes for animations)
- JavaScript

## Using Stitch (by Google) to Refactor Website Graphics

I recently refactored the graphics of my first website using a tool called Stitch (by Google). This tool helped me streamline the design process by automating certain tasks, improving visual consistency, and enhancing overall project efficiency. Below is a brief summary of the changes:

- **Consolidated Images:** I consolidated all images into a single folder to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
- **Unified Styles:** All common graphical elements were moved into a unified style guide to ensure consistency across the website.
- **Optimized Image Formats:** The image formats were optimized for better performance, reducing file sizes without compromising quality.

These changes not only improved the organization of my graphics but also made it easier for me to maintain and update the visual design of the website in the future.
